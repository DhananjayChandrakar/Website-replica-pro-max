            <p>Ecosystem restoration means assisting in the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed,
                as well as conserving the ecosystems that are still intact. Healthier ecosystems, with richer
                biodiversity, yield greater benefits such as more fertile soils, bigger yields of timber and fish, and
                larger stores of greenhouse gases.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Restoration can happen in many ways – for example through actively planting or by removing pressures so
                that nature can recover on its own. It is not always possible – or desirable – to return an ecosystem to
                its original state. We still need farmland and infrastructure on land that was once forest, for
                instance, and ecosystems, like societies, need to adapt to a changing climate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Between now and 2030, the restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded terrestrial and aquatic
                ecosystems could generate US$9 trillion in ecosystem services. Restoration could also remove 13 to 26
                gigatons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The economic benefits of such interventions exceed
                nine times the cost of investment, whereas inaction is at least three times more costly than ecosystem
                restoration.</p>

            <h1>What is Ecosystem Restoration?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>All kinds of ecosystems can be restored, including forests, farmlands, cities, wetlands and oceans.
                Restoration initiatives can be launched by almost anyone, from governments and development agencies to
                businesses, communities and individuals. That is because the causes of degradation are many and varied,
                and can have an impact at different scales.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="content3">
            <p>For instance, degradation may result from harmful policies such as subsidies for intensive farming or
                weak tenure laws that encourage deforestation. Lakes and coastlines can become polluted because of poor
                waste management or an industrial accident. Commercial pressures can leave towns and cities with too
                much asphalt and too few green spaces.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Restoring ecosystems large and small protects and improves the livelihoods of people who depend on them.
                It also helps to regulate disease and reduce the risk of natural disasters. In fact, restoration can
                help us achieve all of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
